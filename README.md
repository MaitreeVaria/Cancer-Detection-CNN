# Cancer Detection CNN

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cancer detection. CNNs are a powerful deep learning technique widely used for image classification tasks, including medical image analysis.

**Note:** This notebook is a part of a Cousera course - [Introduction to Deep Learning : Week 3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-deep-learning-boulder)
In this notebook, we will:

- **Load and preprocess the medical image data**: We'll start by loading and preprocessing medical image data for cancer detection. This typically involves data augmentation and normalization.

- **Build and train a CNN model**: We'll construct a CNN architecture and train it using the preprocessed data. The model will learn to classify images as either cancerous or non-cancerous.

- **Evaluate the model**: We'll assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Provide explanations and insights**: Throughout the notebook, we'll explain the code and provide insights into the process of cancer detection using deep learning.
